How to configure Auth0 to work with RES

Note: When you upgrade your RES version, you will have to reconnect the Auth0 integration by replacing links (replace links set and connection in the RES portal made in steps Create an Auth0 Application for RES and onward). You would also need to point DNS records for portal and vdi to the new load balancers.

Summary: 
Auth0 can integrate with Active Directory via an AD/LDAP connector running on a Windows server that’s domain joined to your AD. Here are the steps:

1. Create an Auth0 account
2. Deploy a Windows instance
3. Deploy and download the AD/LDAP Connector through Auth0 on your Windows instance
4. Create an Application on Auth0 for RES
5. Configure the connector to integrate with your RES application with SAML

Detailed Steps:

1. Modify Security Group Settings

* Add an inbound security group rule to both your AdDomainWindowsNode and AdDomainAdminNode instances
    * Type: LDAP
    * Source: 0.0.0.0/0


2. Deploy a Auth0-Connect-Node Instance

* Choose Launch an Instance
    * Name: (ex. Auth0-Connect-Node)
    * AMI: Microsoft Windows Server 2019 Base - unlike Okta - the Auth0 sync agent only works on MS Windows Server 2019 , so you can’t use the Windows AD Admin node to run the agent. 
    * Instance Type: t2.medium
    * Key Pair: (same key pair that you used to deploy RES)
    * VPC: (change VPC to match that of your RES deployment)
    * Open Advanced Details
        * Domain Join Directory: (join the AD domain used for RES)
        * IAM Instance Profile: AmazonSSMDirectoryServiceInstanceProfileRole (choose a role with AmazonSSMManagedInstanceCore and AmazonSSMDirectoryServiceAccess permissions)
* Add an inbound security group rule on this instance
    * Type: Custom TCP
    * Port: 443
    * Source: 0.0.0.0/0


3. Access Auth0-Connect-Node

* Log in to the new Auth0-Connect-Node as an the RES Admin
    * Choose Connect
    * Navigate to the RDP Client tab
    * Choose Connect Using Fleet Manager
    * Choose Fleet Manager Remote Desktop
    * Add the user credentials for your Admin user of RES


4. Change Security Settings on Desktop

* Open the Windows Start menu
* Click on Server Manager
* Click Local Server
* Select “On” next to IE Enhanced Security Configuration 
* Select “Off” for both Administrators and Users and Save


5. Install Google Chrome (you can continue to use Explorer; however, this process is optimized on Google Chrome)

* Navigate to Internet Explorer and download Google Chrome
    * If Internet Explorer asks about Security Settings, select “Do not use recommended settings”.


6. Create an Enterprise Connection in Auth0

* From Internet Explorer or Google Chrome, open Auth0 and log in to your account
* Navigate to Auth0 Dashboard > Authentication > Enterprise and select Active Directory/LDAP
* Select “Create Connection” 
* Enter a Connection Name and optional Display Name (ex. Auth0-AD-Connection)
* Leave the remaining option as default and Save
* From the resulting screen, copy the Provisioning Ticket URL and select “Install for Windows”

7. Install and Configure the AD/LDAP Connector (reference)

* Download the Auth0 Active Directory/LDAP Connector for Windows (MSI) file - Auth0 Active Directory/LDAP Connector for Windows and open
* When prompted by Windows Defender SmartScreen, select “more info” and then “run anyway”
* Run the installer, leave all options as default, and install
* When prompted, enter the Ticket URL that you copied previously.
* The Windows Installer should prompt you with the screen below with your pre-populated LDAP Connection String and Base DN. PLEASE REMOVE THE IP IN THE LDAP CONNECTION STRING PRIOR TO “corp.res.com” (for example - IP-C12345678)
* Enter ServiceAccount as the username and enter the password to your ServiceAccount.
* Your connection should now show as “Online” in the Auth0 console.

        * Can be found in your RES Web App portal:
            * Tip: If you the additional layer of Auth0 is preventing your from accessing RES, add “/?sso=false” at the end of the URL
            * Log in as Admin or ClusterAdmin
            * Go to the Environment Management tab and then the General Settings page
            * Select the Identity Provider tab and copy your SAML Redirect URL

}

    * Please replace the following lines accordingly:
        * Audience: Replace with urn:amazon:cognito:sp:user-pool-id (add your own user-pool-id - this can be found in your RES Web App - login as Admin or ClusterAdmin, navigate to Environment Management → General Settings → Identity Provider)
        * Recipient: Replace with your SAML Redirect URL (this can be found in your RES Web App - login as Admin or ClusterAdmin, navigate to Environment Management → General Settings → Identity Provider)
        * Destination: Add the domain URL for your RES web app (ex. https://portal.res.alias.people.aws.dev)
        * Callback (under logout section): Add your Cognito Domain (found in the Cognito console or you can use the Domain URL in RES Identity Provider Tab) and add “/logout”
    * Click Enable and then Save
* Navigate to the Usage tab 
    * Where you see Identity Provider Metadata, right-click the Download hyperlink and click Copy Link Address
* Navigate to your RES Console and log in as Admin or ClusterAdmin
